A cleaner WordPress [gallery] that integrates with multiple Lightbox-type scripts.

== Description ==

This plugin was written to take care of the invalid HTML that WordPress produces when using the `[gallery]` shortcode.

It does a bit more than that though.  It will integrate with many Lightbox-type scripts and allow you to do much cooler things with your galleries.  Plus, it has a couple of extra options that you can play around with.

### Features

* Uses HTML5 `<fig>` and `<figcaption>` elements.
* Integrates with [Schema.org microdata](http://schema.org).
* Uses the `aria-describedby` attribute to make images + captions more accessible to users with disabilities.
* Validates the invalid code that WordPress spits out.
* Several options on how you want your gallery images.
* Allows multiple galleries in a single post.
* Ability to set the number of images shown in each gallery.
* Ability to exclude or include any images from your gallery.
* Doesn't load any extra CSS or JavaScript unless you choose to do so.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why was this plugin created?

The purpose of the Cleaner Gallery plugin is to get rid of the invalid HTML output by the default WordPress `[gallery]` shortcode.  Since I was having so much fun with it, I decided to make it compatible with several Lightbox-type image scripts.

It has eventually grown into an extremely robust and flexible image script.

### Why do I have one column of images?

If you expect multiple columns of images but only have one column, it's most likely that your theme is doing something incorrectly.

Also, the Cleaner Gallery plugin stylesheet doesn't load if your theme supports `cleaner-gallery`.  If that's the case, it's your theme's responsibility to style the gallery output.

### My gallery columns aren't working. What to do?

It's impossible for me to say for sure without looking at your site.  More than likely, your theme is overwriting the gallery styles.  You'd need to stop by my [support forums](http://themehybrid.com/support) for support for your specific case.

### Which Lightbox-type scripts will the plugin work with?

The plugin has been tested and works with many different Lightbox-type image scripts.  They are all listed in the plugin description.

### Can you help me set up an image script?

I don't officially support any third-party code whatsoever.  However, I'm more than willing to **attempt** helping you set up your preferred image script via my [support forums](http://themehybrid.com/support).

### Will you add support for X image script?

There's a good chance that I will.  It really depends on how feasible it is.  Some scripts would require re-coding how the plugin works, which is something I probably won't do.  However, most scripts don't require this.

If you'd like for me to add a new image script, please provide me with as much information as you can.  Particularly, a link to the page where I can download the script and view a demo of it.  That will go a long way towards getting support for the script included in this plugin.

### How do I set it up?

Technically, you don't have to set up anything at all.  It should work right out of the box.

However, you do have several configuration options that you can set from the "Appearance > Cleaner Gallery" screen in the admin.

### How do I integrate support for this plugin in a theme?

If you're building a WordPress theme, it's extremely simple to add support for this plugin.  Simply add the following line to your theme's setup function:

	add_theme_support( 'cleaner-gallery' );

Then, copy the plugins `css/gallery.css` file into your theme's stylesheet.  You are free to make any customizations you wish.  It's much more flexible than the default WordPress gallery, so you have a lot of freedom with design choices.

### How do I customize the styles for galleries?

Customizing your galleries can be very simple. Here's some CSS you can add to your theme's `style.css` and modify.

	/* Style rules for the entire gallery */
	.gallery {}
	
		/* Style rules for each item (image and caption) in the gallery */
		.gallery-item {}
		
			/* Style rules for images within the gallery */
			.gallery-icon {}
			
			/* Style rules for captions within the gallery */
			.gallery-caption {}

### Can I paginate galleries?

While the plugin has no way of paginating its own galleries, it's very much possible to make this happen using the WordPress `<!--nextpage-->` tag.

Let's suppose we have 12 images we want to show. The first six will be on the first page while the following six will be on the second page. You'd use this code in the post editor:

	[gallery numberposts="6"]
	
	<!--nextpage-->
	
	[gallery numberposts="6" offset="6"]
